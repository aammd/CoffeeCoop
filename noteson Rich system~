questions for the Maker

in data/info.csv, what is Cash, Assets and MilkOutgoing?

how do you obtain the count?



structure of the program as I understand it:
1) info = a list of 'global' variables - cost of the coffee, milk etc
2) people = a database of all the people in the co-op
*** these two sheets are updated my ME, not the machine, right?

load.data
3) dates have to be entered in info.csv correctly.  There must always be a "Future" column
4) makes a vector of file names, by adding .csv to the end of the dates in info.
5) checks to make sure they exist in the directory
6) checks to make sure ONLY they exist in the directory 
***do I also have to edit a .csv with a matching name? yes it seems so
7) lapply over all file names a function that reads in all the csv files and checks to confirm that they all have exactly the filenames they ought to.
