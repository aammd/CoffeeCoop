## The data for the coffee coop is stored in five spreadsheets
## info, which shows how prices of things change over time
## consumption, which tracks who has consumed milk or coffee, and when
## people, with information on every participant of the Coffee Coop 
## cash, which tracks all movements of cash in and out of the Coop
## goods, data on all non-monetary goods the coop produces.

## the formula for a coffee-coop person's balance is calculated as 

## all payments - consumption*cost_when_consumed + all goods - any cash payments to this person.
