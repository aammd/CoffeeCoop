#dat <- load.data()
## If you just wanted to dump out the data and use your own system,
## then dat$data contains people x period matrices for payment,
## payment date, milk (yes/no), number of coffees, number of teas.

## Generate the website
www(dat)
## Push it to the server
www.copy()

## Do the accounts.  This bit has never worked well, but what it is
## meant to do is check that all the fields have been added in the
## underlying source sheets, generate the new future sheets, etc.
## Have a look at R/accounts.R
do.accounts()

## Check if there are people who have left.  The number is the amount
## of periods over which people have not recorded a coffee.
possibly.gone(dat)

## Generate signup sheets:
## Will be done automatially by do.accounts(), but tuning is sometimes
## needed.
signup.coffee(dat$status)
signup.tea.flag(dat$status)

## edit info to not rely on that same data a new bit of data, similar to a real
## account, which gives the amount of money in and out

## and a separate datasheet to keep track of the timing of donations.
## could even be the same place.  

## I want something to keep track of the money going out for donations, milk& sugar (when those guys ask for cash) and coffee.
